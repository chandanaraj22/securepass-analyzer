# 🛡️ SecurePass Analyzer

> **Enterprise Password Security Assessment Platform**

SecurePass Analyzer is a Flask-based cybersecurity tool that evaluates password strength using multiple security metrics instead of relying solely on basic complexity rules. The application combines entropy estimation, enterprise password policy validation, weak pattern detection, offline breached-password detection, and actionable security recommendations to provide users with a comprehensive password security assessment.

The project follows a modular architecture, making it easy to extend with additional password analysis techniques and security features.
